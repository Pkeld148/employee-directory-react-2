# Employee Directory - React

## Description

The goal of this project was to create an employee directory using the React library.  The app pulls data from the Random User API and displays the information in a table.  This project highlights React's capabilities to quickly and seamlessly render changing information on the screen.

## Installation

All functionality of this project contained within the deployed webpage itself.  Users can navigate to the following address to experience the application:
https://pkeld148.github.io/employee-directory-react-2/

## Usage

When the page loads, the user will be presented with a table of employees (placeholder data pulled from the Random User API).  Refreshing the page will load a new set of employee data.  The user can also click on the "Age" column header to sort according to age.  One of the project's objectives was to include a way to filter the employees' information with a search function, however I was unable to get that aspect working, and it has been left out for now.
